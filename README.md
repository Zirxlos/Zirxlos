## Hello World, and welcome to my GitHub

I am Shawn Ives, a trained material scientist who wants to move to the world of IT.
I have always been interest in CS and always was trying to troubleshoot my computer from a young age.
During my studies, I had experience with some scientifical programming language like Maple and Scilab and I was always keen on using them in university projects.

### What I am currently doing to learn

- The year 2024 is very special to me because I decided that I wanted to take a closer look to the world of code and I enrolled myself on edX with the CS50 introduction to computer science from Harvard.
Although many concepts were not unknown to me, I really loved to be able to start coding with C and later with python. I still haven't finished the different final projects but I am really looking forward to complete them.
- To be able to find a job in this field, I decided to start a further education in the country where I currently live so I am focusing my energy on that program before finishing the Harvard's one and I am really excited about the two projects I am working on and that you will find on my profile.


Apart from this, my focus currently lies on deepening my knowledge of programming itself to not depend on one programming language but be able to work in different kinds of frameworks or teams.
